/* Now our div nad our paragraphs are block elements so they stack on top of each other
but when we float this div element it will take it out of the normal float of the page and we would see our text rap around and you can picture this as an image but whatever content we would float and can float it left or right */

/* p { */
    /* margin-left: 10px; */ /* it moves 10px ender that black square but didn't move next the p next to it as what we expected , the marging is applied from teh left and not as we expected to be for the text on the right of the square even if we use 20% it will move the text below the square and not what we expected (the text next ot the square) to fix that we can apply some to the actual block it self aka our div by using margin-right*/

    border: 1px solid #333;
    padding: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;/* flow-root; */
} /* Everything looks ok and good but when we have just a few words it wouldn't look normal because the float is not in the normal flow of the page so the container is only expending based on the text content 
even if we use a div element with the clear class it would clear only the paragraphs 
we will se two ways to fix it
use overflow: auto; in the section
the correct current way is to say display:flow-root;
but somehow it didn't work for me in firefox*/
